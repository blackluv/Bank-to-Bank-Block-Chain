### Block Chain Based Remittance API
---------------------------------

### Background

Build an API for a block chain based system of sending remittances.

### Challenge

While technology gives consumers new ways to spend money, sending money from one bank to another is still not
a simple process. This is especially true if the banks are located in a different country. This solution would
allow banks to let their users take advantage of the convenience provided by technology and the security provided 
by a block chain. 

### Summary

- A bank uses our API to have a secure, and easy traceable channel to instantly transfer money to another bank regardless of location.

- A user can choose our service from a multitude of banks (instead of a wire transfer) to cheaply, quickly, and securely send money to anyone, anywhere.
