# Bank-to-Bank-Blockchain

### Blockchain Based App for Conducting Financial Transactions
---------------------------------

### Purpose

Build an app that uses a Blockchain to conduct transactions on a distributed ledger. This app simulates how a bank can incorporate the blockchain seamlessly into their existing flow.

### Challenge

While technology gives consumers new ways to spend money, sending money from one bank to another is still not
a simple process. This is especially true if the banks are located in a different country. This solution would
allow banks to let their users take advantage of the convenience provided by technology and the security provided 
by a blockchain. 

### Summary

- Sender chooses to send money instantly. 
- App triggers REST API to initiate transaction from one node to another on the MultiChain blockchain (MultiChain was the blockchain technology chosen. Nodes containing transaction information are stored on AWS instances.) 
- Transaction occurs in seconds.
- The receiver gets a text message notification when funds are received. 

### Technologies

- Swift 2.0, Xcode 7
- Parse.com & Parse Cloud Code
- Twilio
- AWS
- MultiChain
